-  Yo! I’m @T1nm8n
-  I've just begun to learn code after forty years. But, hey, It is never too young to learn. I feel like I'm from the dinosaur age.
-  I’m currently trying to learn a little of each type of language. If anyone has a better methodology, by all means, let me know.
-  You can reach me at my email address: daibhidhpol@gmail.com
-  I don't do the pronoun shit..
